 <h2>OSI Model<h2>

the OSI Model provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. Itâ€™s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

<h2>Socket<h2>

Socket is a way of speaking to other programs using standard file descriptors.

A TCP socket is an endpoint instance
A TCP socket is not a connection, it is the endpoint of a specific connection.
A TCP connection is defined by two endpoints aka sockets.

<h2>Socket Connection<h2>

A socket connection means the two machines have information about each other, including network location (IP address) and TCP port. (If we can use anology, IP address is the phone number and the TCP port is the extension).
